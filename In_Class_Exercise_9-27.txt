1)
Prints:
-------
Pros:
Quick
Easily re-run
Isolated

Cons:
Limited
Need a lot of prints to determine bug
	- can get crowded/ hard to read
Due to it being imperative, this gives limited information
	-hard to track changes


Logger:
-------
Pros:
A lot of info
Automatic

Cons:
Too much info


Instrumentation:
----------------
Pros:
Gives detailed diagnostics

Cons:
Takes long to implement


Debugger:
---------
Pros:
Dynamic approach to evaluation
Easy to step through code with specific tools and all of its evolving states
	(eg: step -into, step -over)
Break points
Easy to hone in on the fault


Cons:
Takes a while
A lot of overhead
Requires specific knowledge of the debugger itself



2)
First check logger for event of submission and check for value that was submitted.
Use debugger to step through when that occured and see what value was submitted and what functions were called.
